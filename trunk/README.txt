Python modules for Software Development Tools
===========

PyDevTools is a suite of python modules for the rapid prototyping of software development tools.
Currently, the project include modules for:
* ELF handling
* DWARF handling

Next, we are planning to add a GDB module containing :
* `RSP <http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Remote-Protocol.html>`
* `MI <http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/GDB_002fMI.html>` 
protocols implementation, this will allow to drive gdbserver and gdb from python scripts.
Please, report a new issue for bugs, or desired features.
(possibly, attaching the target ELF file to reproduce the issue).

'E-mail <mailto:emilmont@gmail.com>`the project owner for any feedback, or for joining the project.
